# HybridApplication
an application using both JavaScript and Java

# Objective:
To create an application that uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the UI and Java for the heavy lifting.

# Post-Mortem:
This project is abandoned as the objective was found to be infeasible.
There is no way to pass rendered images from the Java application to the Web view.
